   <p>     
Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is the firm’s number one strategic priority, and our D&I Strategy puts gender equality at its heart, through a “differential focus on race and gender”.</p> 
<p>We publicly commit to 40 per cent female representation in our partnership by 2025 and we have doubled our investment in coaching and sponsorship programmes for women.</p>

<p> We are a UK-headquartered company, employing around 62,000 staff globally, and supporting more than 19 million customers to access international markets in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America. We’re proud that, in addition to improving the proportion of women in our pipeline by 11 per cent (to 43 per cent) and in our most senior roles by 8 per cent (to 37 per cent), our workforce engagement scores are the highest they have ever been since we started measuring colleague sentiment 10 years ago.
