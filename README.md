## PURPOSE 

This project, Women in Leadership, highlights the conclusion of McKinsey and Company's report of 'Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters 2020’. The purpose of this project is to highlight basic information on why we need to support women into leadership roles and the impact this can have on business outcomes. 

As well as tangible and visual data, Women in Leadership gives examples of female leaders in 2021 and companies currently supporting women into leadership roles.

## INITIAL IDEA AND CONCEPT


Having worked in corporate industry for the past 3 years, it has become apparent the current drive for more women to be supported into leaderships.

As a member of my company’s Women’s Network, I wanted a single website for my colleagues to visit in order to broaden their understanding on why we need more women in leadership today. I wanted a website that would highlight the impact increased diversity is having on business outcomes and overall company success. 
-- - 
FEATURES 

Across the website I wanted to include the continuous features of the top and bottom "navbar" and call to action buttons. I wanted the information to be easy to access and read, along with supplying external links to further information. 

--- ---

## UX and UI:

- I created this website to demonstrate my knowledge and skills of HTML and CSS. 
- I wanted a website users could visit to easily acquire insightful information that was both qualitative and quantitative. 
- I wanted the website to be easy to navigate and to have links to external information. 
- I wanted this webite to be ascetically pleasing with clear images. 

Site goals: 

- To showcase my skills of HTML and CSS.
- To provide the user with easy to access information and external links to read further if desired.
- To provide a site that was easy to navigate and interactive with.

User story:

- As a user I wanted the site to be easy to navigate
- As a user I wanted the site to be easy to read with data to support the written evidence.
- As a user I wanted the site to be ascetically pleasing 
- As a user I wanted the pages and links to be interactive

## Features: 

The site consists of the following: 

Three main pages: Home, Leaders and Industry.

Each page will have a top navigation bar (navbar) including internal links to the home page, leaders page and industry page. 
- Each page will have a footer including links to social media pages.
- Each page will have an interactive element either a link to an external source or call to action
- Each page will have an image to support the text or purpose of the website 

Top navigation bar:

## Layout and Content: 

- Each page will have a top navbar including internal links to the home page, leaders page and industry page. 
- Each page will have a footer including links to social media pages
- Each page will have an interactive element either a link to an external source or call to action

## NAVBAR AND FOOTER

To ensure the user is easily able to navigate through the website the navbar has the page underlined indicating which page the user is viewing. 

![navbar navigation to home, leaders and industry](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/top-nav-bar.png)

When using the footer, each link underlines as the user places their cursor over the link.

## DESIGN:

Colour scheme: 
As this is an educational and factual website the colour scheme was kept neutral with shades of grey and white, see hex colours below. The images have bight bold colours and the call to actions have changing colours when hovered over. The above was added to keep the website engaging and eye-catching. 

![hex colour - white](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/white.png)

![hex colour - whitesmoke](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/whitesmoke.png)

![hex colour - grey](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/grey.png)

![hex colour - dark grey](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/darkgrey.png)

![hex colour - purple](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/purple.png)

I added the colour purple to highlight external links to the user and make sure they stood out from the background.

 ## IMAGE:

There is a total of 6 images across the site. All these images have remained standard as not to distort the pixels. 
All images were compressed using tinyjpg.

## TYPOGRAPHY

The fonts used for the site were sourced from Google Fonts and included; ‘Robot’ and ‘sans-serif’.

 ## TESTING:

USER STORY TESTING:
The site has undergone multiple test across each page including a full validation of html and CSS. 
As a user I wanted to understand the purpose of the website - this is supported by the home page with a welcome paragraph under the heading ‘Welcome to women in leadership”. 

As a user I wanted an easy to navigate site. I included the top navbar which in tern underlines the page on which the user is viewing. The navbar includes the titles of each of the pages in a clear font. 

As a user I wanted the site to contain images and text information in an attractive and easy to process format. This was achieved by ensure adequate spacing and neutral colouring around brightly coloured images. 

As a user I wanted to learn something new, this was achieved by keeping text minimal and including numeric values in order to provide easy memorable information. 

As a user I wanted to have access to further information not included on the website. This was achieved by including external links to websites relating to the topic of the site. 


## MANUAL TESTING:

- The code for this website has been put through a css-validator and a html-validator. Multiple errors were displayed and corrected to ensure the code was error free on submitting the project.

- All links have been clicked and hovered over to ensure accessibility 

- All pages loaded correctly on all size devices that were checked

- All social media links worked correctly and opened in a new tab

- All images loaded on each pages as expected 

- All external links opened in a new tab and went to the correct website, opening in a new tab


Devices: I tested the responsiveness and functionality of the website against the following devices: 

- Moto G4

- iPhone 5

- iPad PRO

- Surface Duo

- Nest Hub Max

And the following web browsers:

- Firefox

- Google Chrome

- Internet Explorer

All were successful in displaying the website correctly with working links and clear iamges.

## LIGHTHOUSE

I ran each live webpage through Chrome Lighthouse and came out with an average performance of 79%.

Wave testing : Across all pages

- Wave flagged a redundant link as an alert across all three pages. This link sits within the navbar and acts as a "Home button". There is also a home link situated in the top left had corner of each page. I kept this in situ as I feel it assists with the navigation of the website. 

Index page: Wave highlighted the underlining of the hero image text as an alert. I kept this as I wanted it to stand out and be the first text the reader saw/read. I kept the underline decoration to make it more eye-catching.

## SOLVED BUGS AND ERRORS 

On my index page I wanted the content to expand and fit the screen. I achieved this using flex box. It required me to set the height to the body and html elements 

On the industry page I realised this was compressing sections of html, this was due to the height being set but not giving a minimum height. 

When minimum hight was set this caused the hero image on the index page to then not have a height. Due to a limited time frame available at this stage I was unable to reach a more dynamic resolution to this therefore used explicit height using calc (css tool).

If more time was available I would try and work out a more generic fix that would apply to all three pages without having to explicitly state a hight for this specific element.  

I went through all the HTMl and CSS and removed any duplicate or unused code as well as removing unwanted lines and spaces. I used

## UNSOLVED BUGS AND ERRORS

These were flagged in the Lighthouse report section, with more time I would address these issues to bring the website performance up to 100%. 

With more time and knowledge I would like to add further pages and images including graphs and information on companies profitability. I would also like to add an option to sign-up for a monthly newsletter and a short survey at the end of the last page.
