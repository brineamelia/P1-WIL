[View live project here](https://brineamelia.github.io/P1-WIL/)

This project highlights the conclusion of McKinsey and Company report of 'Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters’, written in May 2020. Women in Leadership offers a ‘one stop shop’ location to acquire a basic understanding of why we need to support women into leadership roles and the positive impact this is having on business outcomes. 

As well as tangible and visual data, Women in Leadership also gives examples of female leaders in 2021 and companies currently supporting women into leadership roles.

Initial idea and concept

Having worked in corporate industry for the past 3 years it has become apparent the current drive for more women to be supported into leaderships roles and the knock on impact this is having on company outcomes and success. 

As a member of my company’s Women’s Network, I wanted a single website for my colleagues to visit in order to broaden their understanding of why we need more women in leadership but also to understand the impact this can have on companies overall success.

Features: 

Across the website I wanted to include the continuous features of the top and bottom "navbar" and call to action buttons. I wanted the information to be easy to access and read, along with supplying external links to acquire further information. 

UX/UI:

- I created this website to demonstrate my knowledge and skills of HTML and CSS. 
- I wanted a website users could visit to easily acquire insightful information both qualitative and quantitative on the site topic. 
- I wanted the website to be easy to navigate and to have links to external information. 
- I wanted this webite to be ascetically pleasing with clear images. 

Site goals: 

- To showcase my skills of HTML and CSS.
- To provide the user with easy to access information and external links to read further if desired.
- To provide a site that was easy to navigate and interactive with.

User story:

- As a user I wanted the site to be easy to navigate
- As a user I wanted the site to be easy to read with data to support the written evidence

Navbar effects and sfooter ocail media links 

To ensure the user was easily able to navigate through the website the navbar has the page underlined indicating which page the user is viewing.

When using the footer, each link underlines as the user places their cursor over the link.

Design: 
Colour scheme: 
As this is an educational and factual website the colour scheme was kept neutral with shades of grey and white, see hex colours below. The images have bight bold colours and the call to actions has changing colours when hovered over, in order to keep the website engaging and eye-catching. 

![hex colour - whitesmoke](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/whitesmoke.png)
![hex colour - grey](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/grey.png)
![hex colour - purple](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/purple.png)

I added the colour purple to highlight external links to the user and make sure they stood out from the background. 

Images:
There is a total of 6 images across the site. All these images have remained standard as not to distort the pixels. 
All images were compressed using tinyjpg. 

Typography:
The fonts used for the site were sourced from Google Fonts and included; ‘Robot’ and ‘sans-serif’. 

Testing:
The site has undergone multiple test across each page including a full validation for html and CSS. 
As a user I wanted to understand the purpose of the website - this is supported by the home page with a welcome paragraph under the heading ‘Welcome to women in leadership”. 

As a user I wanted an easy to navigate site. I included the top navigation bar which in tern underlines the page on which the user is veiwing. The navigation bar includes the titles of each of the pages in a clear font. 

As a user I wanted the site to contain images and text information in an attractive and easy to process format. This was achieved by ensure adequate spacing and neutral colouring around brightly coloured images. 

As a user I wanted to learn something new, this was achieved by keeping text minimal and including numeric values in order to provide easy memorable information. 

As a user I wanted to have access to further information not included on the website. This was achieved by including external links to websites relating to the topic of the site. 

Devices: I tested the responsiveness and functionality of the website against the following devices: 
Moto G4
iPhone 5
iPad PRO
Surface Duo 
Nest Hub Max
Google Chrome

Validation:  
HTML was put through css-validator and html-validator. Multiple errors were displayed and corrected to ensure none were found once the code was run through the css and html validators again.

Solved bugs and errors:  

wanted content to expand and fit the screen
Used flex box to achieve this - this required height to be set on the body and html elements 
On the industry page realised this was compressing sections of html, this was due to height being set but not min height. 

![image of bug on homepage](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/bug1.png)

However when min hight was set this was causing hero image on index page to not have a height, due to limited time frame available at this stage I was unable to reach a more dynamic resolution to this therefore used explicit height using using calc (css tool) if more time was available I would try and work out a more generic fix that would apply to all three pages without having to explicitly state a hight for this specific element.
