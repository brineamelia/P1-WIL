# **Women in Leadership**

[View live project here](https://brineamelia.github.io/P1-WIL/)

This project highlights many of the findings of the McKinsey and Company report of 'Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters’, written in May 2020. Women in Leadership offers a ‘one stop shop’ location to acquire a basic understanding of why we need to support women into leadership roles and the positive impact this is having on business outcomes. As well as tangible and visual data, Women in Leadership also gives examples of female leaders in 2021 and companies currently supporting women into leadership roles.

Initial idea and concept

Having worked in corporate industry for the past 3 years it has become apparent the current drive for more women to be supported into leaderships roles and the knock on impact this is having on company outcomes and success. 

As a member of my company’s Women’s Network, I wanted a single website for my colleagues to visit in order to broaden their understanding of why we need more women in leadership but also to understand the impact this can have on companies overall success.

Features: 

Across the website I wanted to include the continuous features of the top and bottom "navbar" and call to action buttons. I wanted the information to be easy to access and read, along with supplying external links to acquire further information.
