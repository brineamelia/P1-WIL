# **Women in Leadership**

[View live project here](https://brineamelia.github.io/P1-WIL/)

This project highlights the conclusion of McKinsey and Company report of 'Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters’, written in May 2020. Women in Leadership offers a ‘one stop shop’ location to acquire a basic understanding of why we need to support women into leadership roles and the positive impact this is having on business outcomes. 

As well as tangible and visual data, Women in Leadership also gives examples of female leaders in 2021 and companies currently supporting women into leadership roles.

INITIAL IDEA AND CONCEPT
--

Having worked in corporate industry for the past 3 years it has become apparent the current drive for more women to be supported into leaderships roles and the knock on impact this is having on company outcomes and success. 

As a member of my company’s Women’s Network, I wanted a single website for my colleagues to visit in order to broaden their understanding of why we need more women in leadership but also to understand the impact this can have on companies overall success.

NAVBAR EFFECTS AND FOOTER SOCIAL MEDIA LINKS
---
To ensure the user was easily able to navigate through the website the navbar has the page underlined indicating which page the user is viewing. 

![navbar navitation to home, leaders and industry](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/top-nav-bar.png)

When using the footer, each link underlines as the user places their cursor over the link.

DESIGN:
--
Colour scheme: 
As this is an educational and factual website the colour scheme was kept neutral with shades of grey and white, see hex colours below. The images have bight bold colours and the call to actions has changing colours when hovered over, in order to keep the website engaging and eye-catching. 

![hex colour - whitesmoke](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/whitesmoke.png)
![hex colour - grey](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/grey.png)
![hex colour - purple](https://github.com/brineamelia/P1-WIL/blob/main/docs/purple.png)

I added the colour purple to highlight external links to the user and make sure they stood out from the background.

IMAGE:
--
There is a total of 6 images across the site. All these images have remained standard as not to distort the pixels. 
All images were compressed using tinyjpg. 
-- --

TYPOGRAPHY
--
The fonts used for the site were sourced from Google Fonts and included; ‘Robot’ and ‘sans-serif’. 
-- --
TESTING:
--
The site has undergone multiple test across each page including a full validation for html and CSS. 
As a user I wanted to understand the purpose of the website - this is supported by the home page with a welcome paragraph under the heading ‘Welcome to women in leadership”. 

As a user I wanted an easy to navigate site. I included the top navigation bar which in tern underlines the page on which the user is veiwing. The navigation bar includes the titles of each of the pages in a clear font. 

As a user I wanted the site to contain images and text information in an attractive and easy to process format. This was achieved by ensure adequate spacing and neutral colouring around brightly coloured images. 

As a user I wanted to learn something new, this was achieved by keeping text minimal and including numeric values in order to provide easy memorable information. 

As a user I wanted to have access to further information not included on the website. This was achieved by including external links to websites relating to the topic of the site. 

Devices: I tested the responsiveness and functionality of the website against the following devices: 
Moto G4
iPhone 5
iPad PRO
Surface Duo 
Nest Hub Max
Google Chrome

VALIDATION

HTML was put through css-validator and html-validator. Multiple errors were displayed and corrected to ensure none were found once the code was run through the css and html validators again.

SOLVED BUGS AND ERRORS 
--
I wanted the content to expand and fit the screen, I did this using flex box. It required me to set the height to the body and html elements 
On the industry page I realised this was compressing sections of html, this was due to the height being set but not giving a minimum height. 

However when minimum hight was set this caused the hero image on the index page to then not have a height. Due to a limited time frame available at this stage I was unable to reach a more dynamic resolution to this therefore used explicit height using calc (css tool). If more time was available I would try and work out a more generic fix that would apply to all three pages without having to explicitly state a hight for this specific element.

Wave testing : Across all pages

- Wave flagged a redundent link within the navbar, the link is the "Home" link which is also situated in the top left had corner of each page. I however kept it in situ as I feel it assists with the navigation of the website

Index page: Wave highlighted the underlining of the hero image text however I kept this as I wanted it to stand out and be the first text the reader saw/read. 

Leaders page:
