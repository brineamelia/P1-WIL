                  <h1>Safra Catz has served as CEO of software firm Oracle since September 2014. 

                    Catz was born in Israel, earned a law degree at University of Pennsylvania and worked on Wall Street for 14 years covering the software industry.
                
                    When asked what she thinks is the most significant barrier to female leadership? Safra Catz responded:
                    "The most significant barrier to female leadership is the actual lack of females in leadership. The best advice I can give to women is to go out and start something, ideally their own businesses. If you can't see a path for leadership within your own company, go blaze a trail of your own."
