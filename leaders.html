What do you think is the most significant barrier to female leadership?
The most significant barrier to female leadership is the actual lack of females in leadership. The best advice I can give to women is to go out and start something, ideally their own businesses. If you can't see a path for leadership within your own company, go blaze a trail of your own.Maggie Timoney

<h2>Whitney Wolfe Herd</h2>
   

-Herd is not only one of very few female billionaires, but is now the youngest woman to take a company public in the US 

Wolfe-Herd launched Bumble just two months later. A female-focused app dedicated to women making the first move, Bumble had more than 15million conversations and 8million matches under its belt within the first year.

‘To all the first movers, whether on our platforms, in business, or in life: you’re what today is about. Never take no for an answer, believe in yourselves, and turn your pain into purpose.’
